# CCRGenetics Branch Snakemake Pipeline Telescope

Transposable element annotations used by Telescope.

Telescope is a computational method that provides accurate estimation of transposable element expression. 
It directly addresses uncertainty in fragment assignment by reassigning ambiguously mapped fragments to 
the most probable source transcript as determined within a Bayesian statistical model.


# Running 

Create a folder fastq and add all compressed RNA-seq fastq files to be run with extenntions _R1.fastq.gz and _R2.fastq.gz 

Either file or symlink would work 

To run the pipeline use commands "bash run", results might take upto a few days to finish runnnning
